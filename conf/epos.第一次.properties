### Dataset ###
#The folder name in the datasets path. Make sure it has no spaces, tabs or newlines (alphanum and underscore preferred)
dataset=yrw_1000


### Basic epos properties ###
# any integer > 0
numSimulations=3

# any integer > 0
numIterations=70

# any integer > 0
numAgents=1000

# any integer > 0
numPlans=16

# any integer > 0
numChildren=2

# exact dimensionality from the dataset 144
planDim=144


### Shuffle seeds ###

# initial agent structure before reorganization occurs, any integer > 0
shuffle=70

# path to a file containing permutation of indices, need its strucure: sphinx one column: integer index in each row
shuffle_file="permutation.csv" 
#reorganizationSeed=5

### Weights of the global complex cost ###
numberOfWeights = 2
weightsString = "0.0145924,0.0236076"
# number of weights used in EPOS cost function
# weights are in string format, separated by ","

# weight1: in multiobjective EPOS, this is alpha (in this example 0.2)
# double from [0, 1], alpha + beta <= 1, unfairness
# weight2 in in multiobjective EPOS, this is beta (in this example 0.0)
# double from [0, 1], alpha + beta <= 1, local objective
#a*unfairness + b*local_cost + (1-a-b)*global_costs
#avg local cost is local cost



### Reorganization strategy ###

# possible values: periodically, convergence, globalCostReduction, never. never_strategy: never does reorganization
strategy=convergence

# any integer > 0, if "periodically" strategy is chosen
periodically.reorganizationPeriod=3

# any positive integer (>0), if "convergence" strategy is chosen, the iteration at which the selections will be memorized to be sued after the following reorganization
convergence.memorizationOffset=2

# double from [0, 1]
globalCost.reductionThreshold=0.5

# any integer. Keep the same seed to reproduce experiment results, what random permutations each strategy will explore, result reproducability
strategy.reorganizationSeed=0



#sphinx
#vector target for global response same dimensionality as plan
#filepath
goalSignalPath=default

# Values: "VAR", "RSS", "XCORR", "RMSE"
# Goal signal is ignored in funcitons with only global response as input, e.g. var
globalCostFunction=VAR

# Values: "STD", "UNIT-LENGTH", "MIN-MAX" ( only for RSS).
